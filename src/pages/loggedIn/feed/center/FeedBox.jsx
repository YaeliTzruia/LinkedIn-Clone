You spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all that will ever be is what's happening here, in the decisions we make in this moment, which is based in either love or fear. So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect so we never dare to ask the universe for it - I'm saying, I'm the proof, that you can ask the universe for it. `
